# Test 0010 Review Info
All explanations can be found in the `explanations` directory. They can also be found here: https://thunderredstar.me/Test-2-Review/

Each question is seperated into directories by question type, by number, and each question has its own directory where the readme file and a demo (if that applies) can be found. Go to the bottom of each page to see next/last question and **Demo visualizations!! (a huge accomplishment)**

Remember, this is an open-source repository and you can make edits at any time if you find something wrong! You can make an issue, or if you're feeling adventurous, you can open a pull request!

#### Think: `s i m p l e` Think: `s m a r t`!
